[Web 4.0](http://gsi.dit.upm.es) 
==================================

Introduction
---------------------
Web 4.0 offers a new model of user interaction in the most comprehensive and personalized manner, not limited to displaying information, but intended to behave like a magic mirror that offers concrete solutions to what the user needs. It is an integration layer necessary for the exploitation of Semantic Web and its enormous potential. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google Inc., commented in an interview, "The perfect search engine is the one that returns only one response, which is exactly what you're looking for." This is the foundation of Web 4.0.

Installation instructions
------------------------------
This is the root github repository of the gsibot-client project. Since the code corresponds to a jacascript thin client, it needs no installation at all. By cloning the project and accessing to the popup.html example html page, you can use it.
